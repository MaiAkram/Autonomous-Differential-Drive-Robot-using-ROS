# Autonomous-Differential-Drive-Robot-using-ROS
Through the developed packages using Robot Operating System (ROS), the designed differential-drive robot is to be able to: <br/> 
1 - Map its environment using Hector SLAM and Gmapping. <br/> 
2 - Localize itself within its environment using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) while mapping and Adaptive Monte Carlo (AMCL) while navigating a map. <br/> 
3 - Navigate through a teleoperation mode using keyboard and joystick commands. <br/> 
4 - Navigate auatnomously through NavFn ROS global planner and Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) local planner for reaching a goal point. <br/> 
5 - Following a pre-defined sequence of goal points using waypoints follower. <br/>
